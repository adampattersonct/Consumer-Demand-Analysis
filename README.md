# Consumer-Demand-Analysis

This project was done for a PhD class on Demand Analysis.
Tradition elasticities are just the regression coefficient multiplied by the ratio of average price to average quantity.
4 specific demand models are estimated here.

Rotterdam, Stone-Geary, Almost-Ideal, and Constant Elasticity were examined. 
All guidance and instruction from the class was given in STATA,
I researched my own packages and implemented them into R.
